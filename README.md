Dude, I don't even know how to start this but iHostage was like... if you took Die Hard but then stuffed it inside this weird, creaky old theater with the seats that creak louder than a dying crow?? The popcorn was extra buttery, I swear, more on my pants than in my mouth. anyway, the movie—remember to download the movie, you'll want to rewatch it or, like, get mad at it all over again.

It kicks off with this guy, right, who isn't quite Bruce Willis but he has that I've seen too much look, and there's a hostage thing and it’s tense. Or maybe I was just tense from sitting in the chair that felt like an ancient torture device? And oh my god, the audio was echoing like they recorded it in a bathroom. I could hardly hear over someone chomping on their nachos behind me, and it kind of mixed into the soundtrack. 

> Midway through, there's this plot twist that's like... why though? As if a cheese grater randomly appeared in a bakery—like, why are you here? But everyone in the theater gasped, and I dropped my drink, so maybe it's genius. Or maybe I'm easily distracted. It could go both ways.

Anyway, he saves the day (or doesn't?) with this plan that would only work if you're fluent in action-movie logic. By the end, I was more invested in trying to get the popcorn kernels out of my seat than the protagonist's destiny. And who was the villain again? That one guy... with the hair? My back was aching so badly like I'd been wrestling with the metaphors or sumn.

Some people said watch the movie tonight, but I think I'd rather sit in that creaky chair again with less butter on my clothing. Like, why was the dog important? Did I miss something when I blinked, or was it just symbolic, like my eternal struggle with overcooked popcorn?

And oh god, the colors were vivid but had this weird yellow-green tinge like someone put mustard on their lens, which is, ironically, what my popcorn tasted like halfway through.

function hostagePlotTwist(gasp) {
    if (unexpected) {
        return No, but why?;
    } else {
        return Of course. It makes no sense.;
    }
    // Another day, another plot
}
